 ## Brief:
 ### This study examines the predictive effects of the Baidu and Douyin search indices on the volatility of the Shanghai Composite 50 Index, addressing the research gap regarding the Douyin search index in finance and offering valuable insights for future multi-source data integration and model enhancement.
 ### *Designed and implemented financial time series forecasting models independently, using GARCH-X in RStudio and decision tree regression in VSCode;*
 ### *Identified the limitations of Random Forest in this context and selected the GARCH-X model as a more suitable alternative based on model performance and domain relevance;*
 ### *Determined optimal GARCH-Xparameters (p, d, q) through differencing and analysis of ACF/PACF plots; iteratively refined parameter values to ensure model stability and computational efficiency;*
 ### *Integrated Baidu and Douyin search indices into the model, evaluated their lag structure and coefficient significance, and demonstrated that both improved forecast accuracy.*
